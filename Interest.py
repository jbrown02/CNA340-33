"""Write a function howManyyears(start, rate, savings, target) where:

start - the starting balance in your retirement account (float)

rate - the yearly interest rate (float) - like 0.001 for 0.1%

saving - the yearly amount saved for retirement (float)

target - the target retirement that youâ€™d like to achieve

The function returns how many years it takes to reach target retirement amount. 

So, next_month_balance = start_balance * (1 + rate) + savings"""
