# Monthly Savings Interest

This assignment was to create a program that calculates how many months it would take for the interest on a savings account to meet a certain goal with a certain interest rate. In this case, I had the parameters set to tell me how many months it will take for an account with a balance of $1000 to reach a balance of $2000 with a monthly interest rate of 0.05% and no monthly expenditure.

## Getting Started

These instructions will install the necessary components on your local machine so that you will be able to run this program, as well as give you methods for running it.

### Prerequisites

Interest.py requires Python 3 to run. Complete the following steps:

```
1. Install Python 3 via https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Install Pycharm via https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/
3. Download Interest.py
```

## Running
Once installed, you can drag and drop the Interest.py file to access the program.

Alternatively, you can copy the text of the code into your IDE and run it from there:

```
1. Open Interest.py in Notepad, TextEdit, etc.
2. Copy body text
3. Paste text into Pycharm
4. Run program inn Pycharm
```

## Thanks
I'd like to thank Justin Ellis for helping me simplify my code. I was able to figure out a function on my own that accomplished the required task, but shortening the syntax with "and" in my while statement eliminated two extra if else statements.
